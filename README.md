# Course Projects Collection

Welcome to my Course Projects Collection repository! This repository contains various tasks, projects, and assignments I have completed as part of different online courses from platforms like Coursera and others.

## Introduction
This repository is a collection of my coursework tasks and projects. Each directory represents a different subject or course, and contains relevant code, data, and documentation. This collection showcases my learning journey and the skills I've developed through these courses.
